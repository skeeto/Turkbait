This is a very crude World of Warcraft fishing bot. Put the game in
fullscreen windowed mode (need window manager compositing for screen
capture), put your character's feet at the edge of the water, sit, and
run this command to align the camera:

    /run SetView(4)

Pick a flat-colored location that doesn't have bright spots. The
bobber should be the brighest thing in the fishing portion of the
screen.

Don't ask me for help.
