This is a very crude World of Warcraft fishing bot. Every location
requires its own parameter tweaking and it's specifically tuned to my
screen resolution (1689x1050) at the moment. Don't ask me for help.

Parameters are set in config.properties.  This file needs to be in the same directory as Turkbait.class when running.
